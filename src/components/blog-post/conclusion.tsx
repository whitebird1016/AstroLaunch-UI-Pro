            The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world
            shun people for being great. For being a bright color. For standing
            out. But the time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you
            believe in what you believe in, if you were the only one who believed
            it?

            If everything I did failed - which it doesn&apos;t, it actually
            succeeds - just the fact that I&apos;m willing to fail is an
            inspiration. People are so scared to lose that they don&apos;t even
            try. Like, one thing people can&apos;t say is that I&apos;m not
            trying, and I&apos;m not trying my hardest, and I&apos;m not trying to
            do the best way I know how.

            There&apos;s nothing I really wanted to do in life that I wasn&apos;t
            able to get good at. That&apos;s my skill. I&apos;m not really
            specifically talented at anything except for the ability to learn.
            That&apos;s what I do. That&apos;s what I&apos;m here for. Don&apos;t
            be afraid to be wrong because you can&apos;t learn anything from a
            compliment.
            <br />
            <br />
            It really matters and then like it really doesn&apos;t matter. What
            matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are
            like offended by it, it doesn&apos;t matter. Because it&apos;s about
            motivating the doers. Because I&apos;m here to follow my dreams and
            inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.

            As we live, our hearts turn colder. Cause pain is what we go through
            as we become older. We get insulted by others, lose trust for those
            others. We get back stabbed by friends. It becomes harder for us to
            give others a hand. We get our heart broken by people we love, even
            that we give them all we have. Then we lose family over time. What
            else could rust the heart more over time? Blackgold.

            Society has put up so many boundaries, so many limitations on
            what&apos;s right and wrong that it&apos;s almost impossible to get a
            pure thought out.
